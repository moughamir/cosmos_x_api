# Cosmos Products API - Development Plan

## Phase 1: OpenAPI Documentation - COMPLETED âœ…

### What's Done
- Set up comprehensive OpenAPI specification in `openapi-spec.php`
- Removed redundant `OpenApi.php` file
- Implemented Swagger UI at `/cosmos/docs`
- Added JSON endpoint at `/cosmos/docs/json`
- Documented all major endpoints with request/response schemas

## Phase 2: Input Validation - IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

### Completed Tasks
- Created validation system with rules:
  - Required fields
  - String length validation
  - Numeric validation with min/max
  - Email validation
  - Enum/in-list validation
- Implemented `ValidationMiddleware`
- Added `ValidatesRequests` trait for controllers
- Updated `ApiController` with basic validation
- Created `SimilarityService` for product similarity

### Current Work
- Fixing remaining issues:
  - `msgpack_pack` function handling
  - `$container` property in `ApiController`
  - `getPrecomputedRelated` method implementation
  - Unassigned `$params` variable

## Phase 3: Testing - PLANNED ðŸ“‹

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Controller tests
- [ ] Service tests
- [ ] Validation tests
- [ ] Integration tests

### API Tests
- [ ] Endpoint validation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization - PLANNED âš¡

### Caching
- [ ] Implement Redis caching layer
- [ ] Cache common queries
- [ ] Cache API responses

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Add missing indexes
- [ ] Optimize queries
- [ ] Implement read replicas if needed

## Phase 5: Deployment - PLANNED ðŸš€

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Auto-scaling

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Development setup guide

## Known Issues

1. **`msgpack_pack` function**
   - Status: In Progress
   - Solution: Fallback to JSON when extension not available

2. **`$container` property in `ApiController`**
   - Status: Needs Implementation
   - Solution: Add container property and update constructor

3. **`getPrecomputedRelated` method**
   - Status: Implemented in SimilarityService
   - Next: Update related code to use this method

4. **Unassigned `$params` variable**
   - Status: Needs Investigation
   - Location: Around line 287 in ApiController.php

## Next Steps

1. Complete the validation system implementation
2. Fix remaining PHP errors and warnings
3. Write unit tests for new features
4. Implement caching for better performance
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
- All code should follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use PHP 8.1+ features where appropriate
- Document all public methods with PHPDoc
- Write tests for all new functionality
